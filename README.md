# recursive-decent-AST-parser

This is a small attempt to create a parser for the grammar
```
expression → factor ( "/" | "*" ) term
factor     → unary ( "/" | "*" ) factor
unary      →  "-" NUMBER | NUMBER
```

Will will be implementing the following features during this project:

- [ ] Basic calculation i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
